# html-export-example
Isha, Tom, John,
See published GitHub Page here: https://daniellecox.github.io/html-export-example/#id=pcfslm&p=samples_wip&c=1

This is an example of an Axure design file exported to HTML, then added to repo and published using GitHub Pages.  
You can demo the interaction by selecting the checkboxes on the left (each selection deductively filters from the complete set of results).
LMK if you have questions.  

Thanks,
Danielle
